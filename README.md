# Algorithms For Realtime Rendering

This repository contains code examples and exercises discussed in the lecture "algorithms for realtime rendering" to help understand and implement various algorithms used in real-time rendering applications.

## Overview

The repo showcases various algorithms used in computer graphics. 

For rendering, it uses the SORS Framework, developed by Prof. Dr. Dreier. The SORS Framework serves as a robust starting point for implementing advanced rendering techniques, while also providing essential and easy-to-use functionality for basic rendering tasks. It uses OpenGL as the graphics API and Qt for creating windows and other useful functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started follow these steps:

1. Make sure [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) is installed on your System (recommended version: 6.5) and added to the path environment variable (on windows)

2. Clone this repository to your machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chFleschutz/algorithms-for-realtime-rendering.git
   ```

3.  Open the folder in a CMake supported IDE (like Visual Studio)

4. Run Cmake and select the project to execute and build
